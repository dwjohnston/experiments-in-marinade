- 2/3 cup olive oil
- 1/2 cup light soy
- slightly less than 1/2 cup dark soy
- 3 lemons
- 1 Tbsp garlic
- 1/2 Tbsp ginger
- 1/4 cup chilli powder

Finger dip tasting notes: 
- Probably not hot enough
- Too much dark soy? Try reducing dark soy, and also lemon. 
- Orange flavour comes through much better. 
- Maybe next time, lets try adding tomatoes?
